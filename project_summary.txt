🏋️‍♂️ Exercise Analyzer App — Project Master Document

🌟 Overall Goal
> Build a mobile + backend system where users can:
> ✅ Upload exercise videos (starting with sit-ups)
> ✅ Receive science-backed feedback on posture and technique
> ✅ Get an overlay “ghost” video showing ideal form
> ✅ Access a report directly in the mobile app

The MVP includes:
✅ FastAPI backend
✅ Celery background workers
✅ Redis queue
✅ Flutter mobile app frontend (to be built)
✅ Deployment on Railway (or similar cloud)

---------------------------------------------

✅ Completed Sections & Steps

🔧 1️⃣ Local Backend Development
✅ Developed core Python script (exercise_v2.py) analyzing uploaded videos using OpenCV, MediaPipe
✅ Built FastAPI backend (exercise_api_backend.py) to receive videos, return posture feedback + report
✅ Added overlay “ghost” video functionality
✅ Added file saving: uploads/ + processed/

⚙ 2️⃣ Background Worker System
✅ Added Celery + Redis integration (worker.py)
✅ Updated FastAPI routes: /analyze queues job, /status/{job_id} checks progress
✅ Updated project structure with app/ folder
✅ Updated imports to match new app/ layout
✅ Updated requirements.txt to include Celery, Redis, FastAPI, OpenCV, MediaPipe

🐳 3️⃣ Docker & Compose Setup
✅ Wrote Dockerfile
✅ Wrote docker-compose.yml to spin up backend, worker, Redis
✅ Verified local Compose config (pending final test after Docker install)

🌍 4️⃣ Cloud Deployment (Railway)
✅ Created Railway project + linked GitHub repo
✅ Successfully deployed FastAPI backend
✅ Generated public Railway domain
✅ Verified live docs at /docs

---------------------------------------------

🚧 Pending / Next Steps

🚀 1️⃣ Complete Local Docker Test
- Finish Docker Desktop install
- Clean disk space + rerun: docker compose up --build

📱 2️⃣ Build Flutter Mobile App Skeleton
- Connect to backend’s /analyze and /status
- Upload videos, display results

🏗 3️⃣ Production Background Worker Setup
- Deploy Redis on Railway or Railway Redis add-on
- Deploy Celery workers alongside backend

🛡 4️⃣ Optional Enhancements
- Add authentication (API keys, JWT)
- Add database to store past analyses
- Add real-time WebSocket updates
- Add GitHub Actions CI/CD

---------------------------------------------

🛠 Common Bugs / Issues (Resolved)
✅ Couldn’t install mediapipe → fixed with correct Python + requirements.txt
✅ cv2 ModuleNotFoundError → fixed by ensuring OpenCV installed inside venv
✅ Git lock errors → fixed by removing .git/index.lock
✅ Git push hanging → fixed by checking repo size
✅ FastAPI 502 on Railway → solved with background worker system + smaller test videos
✅ docker-compose not found → switched to docker compose + installed Docker Desktop
✅ Docker internal build errors → pending resolution with disk cleanup + Docker cache reset
